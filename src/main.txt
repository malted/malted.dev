Hi! People call me Malted.


I like writing shaders, travelling to strange places, tinkering in Rust, and doing casual investigative journalism.

I used to work at Hack Club (hackclub.com), working on 501(c)(3) financial infrastructure and building the world's biggest hackathons. Now I'm bobbing around the world crunching big data :o

I'm reading Why Nations Fail right nowðŸŽµ

I move around a lot but right now ðŸ“Œ DM me on Spotify (malted.dev/spotify) if you want to meet up!

This website is streamed plaintext from a custom Rust webserver - source at github.com/malted. There are secrets hidden between these lines...


See you around!
