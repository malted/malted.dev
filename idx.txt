ðŸ¥º greeting ðŸ¥º People call me Malted. I research computer graphics & trick them into crunching numbers just the right way. Most days, I push to github.com/hackclub. Other days, I force push to github.com/malted.

It's my job to;
â˜ž Design hypertext documents 
â˜ž Write hypertext documents
â˜ž Get the hypertext documents to show up on people's screens when they type the silly little uniform resource locator and hit carriage return new line
â˜ž Write backend services & orchestrate the apropriate infrastructure to facilitate the aformentioned (invisible code to make the documents worth reading)

It's not my job to;
â˜ž Write shaders (think GLSL, HLSL, Metal, ShaderGraph) yet I do it anyway.

You should read;
â˜ž Why the Future Doesn't Need Us - Bill Joy for WIRED
â˜ž docs.vulkan.org - KHRONOS Group
â˜ž My Family and Other Animals - Gerald Durrell

As of a couple of minutes ago, ðŸ¥º location ðŸ¥º Message me @Malted on the Hack Club Slack (hackclub.com/slack) or email my name at this domain. I wish this were HTML so I could say something like <a href="tel:malted@malted.dev">FaceTime me!</a>. Alas, it isn't. If you're in a pinch, phone me at +1 (802) GOON-APE.
