ðŸ¥º greeting ðŸ¥º. People call me Malted. I research computer graphics & trick them into crunching numbers just the right way. Most days, I push to github.com/hackclub. Other days, I force push to github.com/malted. I love open source but this site is not. Just to drive you nuts.


It's my job to;
â˜ž Design hypertext documents 
â˜ž Write hypertext documents
â˜ž Get the hypertext documents to show up on people's screens when they type the silly little uniform resource locator and hit carriage return new line
â˜ž Write backend services & orchestrate the apropriate infrastructure to facilitate the aformentioned (invisible code to make the documents worth reading).

It's not my job to;
â˜ž Write shaders (think GLSL, HLSL, Metal, ShaderGraph) yet I do it anyway.

You should read;
â˜ž Why the Future Doesn't Need Us - Bill Joy for WIRED
â˜ž docs.vulkan.org - KHRONOS Group
â˜ž My Family and Other Animals - Gerald Durrell 

As of a couple of minutes ago, I'm in ðŸ¥º city ðŸ¥º; so we're around ðŸ¥º distance ðŸ¥º apart from each other right now. ðŸ¥º I should put a call to action here ðŸ¥º. Message me @Malted on the Hack Club Slack (hackclub.com/slack) or email my name at this domain.

















Beep boop. This page took ðŸ¥º no time at all ðŸ¥º to render.
